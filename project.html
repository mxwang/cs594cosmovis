<a id="intro" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>I. Introduction:</h3>
<h6> - Describe the background of the cosmology application for
the contest.</h6>
<body> We are surrounded by galaxies
and clusters of galaxies interconnected by a vast cosmic web. The gravitational forces exerted
by dark matter halos play an important role in the formation of clusters of galaxies.
To study the evolution of halos over time and space would greatly benefit our understanding of the universe.
Typically, the halo finding plays
the key role in the structure identification. How the structures
of halo and the substructures inside halo interact, merge,
separate and grow is our interest for the cosmology simulation.</body>
<h6>- Overview the specific tasks listed in the contest that you
will be tackling.</h6>
<p> Mainly, the tasks are to create the framework to ingest,
process, organize and visualize the particle data.
Specifically, the framework should be able to process
the high-dimensionality datasets of halo, and visualize
the properties of halos and halos evolution. Then, the halos and their
substructures should be identified with their typical mass and density property.
After that, with the tracking of halos and substructures in the datasets, we can analyze the
merging and spliting of them.
Moreover, the semi-analytical models would be used to help understand
the formation of clusters of galaxies.</p>
<h6>- Define the scope of your project and the expected results. </h6>
<p> The main tasks of our project are to identify and visualize the halos(and substructures) and their evolution. First, we would create
a framework to ingest, process, organize and visualize the data. Second, halos and
the substructures of halos would be identified, and output the file which saved the total numbers of halos and their properties.
Third, the visualization of the dark sky and halos evolution would be designed. We expect to have a vivid simulation of the dark space constituting
of the halos, and the substructure of the halo could be
observed with zooming in the window. Moreover, Tracking of the halos would
be implemented based on the data of different time, and the halos merge tree finally be obtained using the tracking results.

<a id="data" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>II. The data:</h3>
<h6> - Describe the contest datasets: the formats, the information contained in the data sets and the relationships between the data sets. </h6>
<p> 1. The data format is SDF.This format is composed of a human readable ASCII header followed by raw binary data.
It provides the raw particle data, which is described by a position vector, velocity vector, and unique particle identifier.
The data starting from ds14_scivis_0128_e4_dt04_0.0200 to ds14_scivis_0128_e4_dt04_1.0000, are the snapshots of different time.</p>
<p> 2. The folder of RockStar: It includes all the ouputs files of the Rockstar. Moreover,the obtained merger tree is also given.
</p>
<p> 3. Other related files in the top folder provide some ic information, and related database file.
</p>
<p> <b>- If you will perform any transformation, describe your methods and explain how the data transformation will help to perform the tasks. </b></p>
<h3>
<a id="rather-drive-stick" class="anchor" href="#rather-drive-stick" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>III. The tasks:</h3>
<h6>- Explain the selected tasks in more detail </h6>
<p> Task 1: 1. The user could choose which data to load 2.After loading the data, the user could analyze the data.
For instance, finding the halos or the substructures of the halos. 3. The data could be well organized. The data
of different time would be compared to obtain the halos evolution information. 4. The user would have many choices
of the visualization, and they can choose the one to show the information they want.
</p>
<p> Task 2: 1: halo identification: based on the special mass, density character of halos, they can be identified.
And output the file which stores the halos information row by row, and the columns includes: mass, position, and velocity etc.
2: Obtain the Merger trees which describe the evolution of halos over time. With mapping the halos properties, we
track the merging or spliting apart of those halos. Another difficulty is how to well visualize of the evolution by
the visualization techniques.
</p>
<p>Task 4: 1: halo substructure identification: inside a halo, we also use the mass, density character to recognize
the halo substructures
2: Visualize the halo substrures: For instance, in a 3D image, use differe colors to indicate the different properties.
Another example is to visualize the substructure evolution, such as their transfering from one host halo to another.
</p>
<h6>- Describe the algorithmic and data analysis components required to perform the tasks </h6>
<p> 1. The halo finding algorithms: such as "Bound Density Maximum" which detects local density maxima,
determines the bounds of the halo, and "Friends-of-Friends" which sets a distance threshold between particles.
2. The tracking algorithm for halos and substructures. Choose some efficient feature values and feather matching methods
to track of the structures.
3. Some database techniques used in the creating of Merger Tree. Storing the evolution relationships in an efficient way.

<h6>- Describe the existing software that you will be using to
read, process, and analyze the data.</h6>
<p>We will be using yt for read, process, and analyze the data. VTK
will be primary used for visualization. And paraView might be used for
analyzing, visualizing and examing the data.</p>
<h6> - Describe the software that you will be creating </h6>
<p>The simulator that we are creating is used for identifying,
exploring and analysing the dark matter halos and their evolution.
It provides different ways of visualizing and interacting the halos
so as to convey maximum information to the user. </p>

<a id="software" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>V. Visualization design</h3>

<p> 1. Display the particles projection into given direction</p>

<p> 2. Show the found halos distribution in the 3D space</p>

<p>T1: Initial data integration and browsing</p>
<p>Visualization for task 1 will show a simulated universe ( or galaxy) covering a
volume of particles.</p>
<p>Users are able to : </p>
<p> - rotate the volume of particles.Using button on GUI or point to
screen and then drag. </p>
<p> - zoom into a subset of simulated data (into a dense region), and further down to dark
matter halos, and satellite halos.(Dark matter halos envelope numerous smaller group of dark matter particles called satellite
halos. Each of these satellite halos are stayed together by dark
matter gravitational fields. ) Interaction are done by using mouse to
specify a region or click button on
interface for overall zooming {{site.url}}.</p>

<p> - adjust alpha value of each particle<p>
<p> - adjust each paritcle size </p>
<p> - load different size of particles</p>
<p>T2: Halo identification and visualization</p>
<p> Visualization for task 2 will still be a simulated universe
convering a volume of particles, but multiple subhalos will be shown
with different colors according to their unique identitifier.</p>
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mxwang/cs594cosmovis/gh-pages/images/t2_color.JPG" alt="colors for different sub halos" style="width:634px;height:344px">
<p>Sub_windows will be used to analyze the data sets and to extract
quantitative information of halos, for
instance, mass, velocity, position, characteristic radiusand
etc, can be switched to visualize in the sub_window.</p>
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mxwang/cs594cosmovis/gh-pages/images/t2_subwindow.JPG" alt="Analytical window for quantitative info." style="width:637px;height:383px">
<p>Gravitational forces exerted by halos and satellite halos can be used
for tracking their movement over time. Glyphs on each particls
show direction of movement of each particle. By tracking these
information, visualization can represents the evolution of each
satellite halo and host halo from their birth untile they either merge, split
or die.</p>

<p>Users are able to: </p>
<p>- investigate the quantitative informaiton of halos by turning on the
sub_windows </p>
<p>- investigate different quantitative informaiton by selecting
different properties of halos </p>
<p>- track the movement of halos by turning on/off the Glyphs feature </p>

style="width:580px;height:489px">
<p>T4: Diving Deep into Halo Substructure</p>
<p>Visualization for task4 can be combined with task 3. Investigting
the quantitative information of halos can be extend to comparing two
similarly-sized sub_halos with different substructure characteristics.</p>
<p>Visualizating in task 3 represents multple subhalos in host_halos
with different colors according to their unique identifier. In task 4,
varying shades of color can be chosen to indicate their level of different properties. For
example, if we want to compare the mass of components, then dark blue
for least massive, bright blue for most massive, etc.</p>
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mxwang/cs594cosmovis/gh-pages/images/t4_levelprop.JPG" alt="vary shades of color" style="width:639px;height:388px">
<p>Users are able to:</p>
<p>- comparing quantitative information of two sub_halos by turing on a
data analytics view (subwindow) </p>
<p>- comparing different quantitative information of two subhalos by
selecting its properties (mass, velocity, etc) in subwindow </p>
<p>- The varying shades of color is to indicate its level of
properties (mass by default), users can choose to visualize other
properties.</p>

<h6>- Describe the expected results from your project </h6>
<p>By visualizing halos in 3D, we hope we could provide useful
information about halos. We hope from the visualiztion, users can
identifty whether is a host halo or sub halo. Users can get insights
of substructure characteristics from data analytical view. Users can
classify whether a halo is born, dies,splits or merges. </p>
