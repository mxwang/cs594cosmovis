<h3>
<a id="intro" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>I. Introduction:</h3>

      <p> -  Describe the background of the cosmology application for
      the contest. </p>
      <body> During its 13.7 billion year of our universe, it progressed 
      from small fluctuations that we see in the cosmic microwave 
      background to today, where we are surrounded by galaxies 
      and clusters of galaxies interconnected by a vast cosmic web. 
      The simulations of the formation of structure in the Universe 
      would benefit our understanding of the universe. 
      However, it is very challenge to simulate this large number 
      of particles, and spatial structure forming by gravitational 
      interaction and collapse. Typically, the halo finding plays 
      the key role in the structure identification. How the structures 
      of halo and the substructures inside halo interact, merge, 
      separate and grow is our interest for the cosmology simulation.</body>
      <p>-  Overview the specific tasks listed in the contest that you
      will be tackling.</p>
      <body>Mainly, the test is to create a basic framework to ingest, process, organize and visualize the particle data. Specifically, the framework should be able to process

the high-dimensionality datasets of halo, and visualize the properties of halos(position, velocity, angular momentum, etc). Moreover, the semi-analytical models would

be provided in the simulation to analyze the structure formation. Furthermore, diving deep into the Halo substructure, such as coloring substructure components by mass

with varying shades of color shared across all substructure components, that would help us getting a deep sense of how star formed, etc.</body>
      <p>-  Define the scope of your project and the expected results. </p>
      <body>In our project, the main task is to identify and visualize the halos and their evolution. First, we would create
        a framework to ingest, process, organize and visualize the data. Second, in the stage of halos identification, halos and
        the substructures of halos would be identified, and output the file which saved the total numbers and their characteristic.
        Third, some visualization of the halos evolution would be designed. We expect to have 3-D image of the dark space constituting
        of the halos, and the substructure of the halo could be observed after zooming in the image. Moreover, Tracking of the halos would
        be implemented using the data of different time, and the halos merge tree would be obtained based on the tracking results.

<h3>
<a id="data" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>II. The data:</h3>

      <p> - Describe the contest datasets: the formats, the information contained in the data sets and the relationships between the data sets. </p>
      <p> The data format is SDF.This format is composed of a human readable ASCII header followed by raw binary data.
       It provides the raw particle data, which is described by a position vector, velocity vector, and unique particle identifier.
       The data: starting from ds14_scivis_0128_e4_dt04_0.0200 to ds14_scivis_0128_e4_dt04_1.0000, are the snapshots of different time.
      </p>
      <p>- If you will perform any transformation, describe your methods and explain how the data transformation will help to perform the tasks. </p>

<a id="rather-drive-stick" class="anchor" href="#rather-drive-stick" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>III. The tasks:</h3>

      <p>-  Explain the selected tasks in more detail </p>
      <p> Task1: 1. The user could choose which data to load 2.After loading the data, the user could analyze the data.
      For instance, finding the halos or the substructures of the halos. 3. The data could be well organized. The data 
      of different time would be compared to obtaint the halos evolution information. 4. The user would have many choices
      of the visualization, and they can choose the one to show the information they want.
        
      </p>
      <p> Task2: Step1: halo identification: based on the special mass, density character of halos, they can be identified.
      And output the file which stores the halos information row by row, and the columns includes: mass, position, and velocity and so on.
      Step 2: Obtain the Merger trees which describe the evolution of halos over time. With mapping the halos properties, we
      track the merging or spliting apart of those halos. Another difficulty is how to well illustrate of the evolution course by
      the visualization techniques.
      </p>  
      <p>Task4:Step 1: halo substructure identification: inside a halo, also use the mass, density character to recognize
      the halo substrures
      Step 2: Visualize the halo substrures: For instance, in a 3D image, use differe colors to indicate the different properties.
      Besides, we can also visualize the substrucure evolution, such as their transfering from one host halo to another.
      </p>  
      <p>-  Describe the algorithmic and data analysis components required to perform the tasks </p>

<a id="software" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>V. Visualization design</h3>

      <p>- Describe the visualization that you will be creating for
the tasks </p>

<p>T1: Initial data integration and browsing</p>
<p>Visualization for task 1 will show a simulated universe ( or galaxy?) covering a
volume of particles. Users are able to : </p>
<p> - rotate the volume of particles, </p>
<p> - zoom into a subset of simulated data (into a dense region), and further down to dark
matter halos, and satellite halos. (Dark matter halos envelope
numerous smaller group of dark matter particles called satellite
halos. Each of these satellite halos are stayed together by dark
matter gravitational fields. ) </p> 
<p> - zoom out to see the simulated universe </p>


<p>
The upper left panel shows all the
particles in the box colored with respect to their velocities, the lower left panel shows a zoom-in into a dense region. The upper right panel shows a histogram of
halo velocities. The lower right panel shows only the particles that reside within halos

</p>


<p>Task 2</p>
<p> - particles can be colored by velocity,  </p>
<p></p>
<p>Task 4</p>

      <p> - Describe how users can interact with the data  </p>
