<h3>
<a id="intro" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>I. Introduction:</h3>

      <p> -  Describe the background of the cosmology application for
      the contest. </p>
      <body> During its 13.7 billion year of our universe, it progressed 
      from small fluctuations that we see in the cosmic microwave 
      background to today, where we are surrounded by galaxies 
      and clusters of galaxies interconnected by a vast cosmic web. 
      The simulations of the formation of structure in the Universe 
      would benefit our understanding of the universe. 
      However, it is very challenge to simulate this large number 
      of particles, and spatial structure forming by gravitational 
      interaction and collapse. Typically, the halo finding plays 
      the key role in the structure identification. How the structures 
      of halo and the substructures inside halo interact, merge, 
      separate and grow is our interest for the cosmology simulation.</body>
      <p>-  Overview the specific tasks listed in the contest that you
      will be tackling.</p>
      <body>Mainly, the test is to create a basic framework to ingest, process, organize and visualize the particle data. Specifically, the framework should be able to process

the high-dimensionality datasets of halo, and visualize the properties of halos(position, velocity, angular momentum, etc). Moreover, the semi-analytical models would

be provided in the simulation to analyze the structure formation. Furthermore, diving deep into the Halo substructure, such as coloring substructure components by mass

with varying shades of color shared across all substructure components, that would help us getting a deep sense of how star formed, etc.</body>
      <p>-  Define the scope of your project and the expected results. </p>

<h3>
<a id="data" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>II. The data:</h3>

      <p> - Describe the contest datasets: the formats, the information contained in the data sets and the relationships between the data sets. </p>
      
      <p>- If you will perform any transformation, describe your methods and explain how the data transformation will help to perform the tasks. </p>
      

<h3>
<a id="rather-drive-stick" class="anchor" href="#rather-drive-stick" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>III. The tasks:</h3>

      <p>-  Explain the selected tasks in more detail </p>

      <p>-  Describe the algorithmic and data analysis components required to perform the tasks </p>


<h3>
<a id="software" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>IV. Software</h3>

      <p>- Describe the existing software that you will be using to
      read, process, and analyze the data.</p>

      <p> - Describe the software that you will be creating </p>

<h3>
<a id="software" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>V. Visualization design</h3>

      <p>- Describe the visualization that you will be creating for
the tasks </p>

<p>T1: Initial data integration and browsing</p>
<p>Visualization for task 1 will show a simulated universe ( or galaxy?) covering a
volume of particles. Users are able to : </p>
<p> - rotate the volume of particles, </p>
<p> - zoom into a subset of simulated data (into a dense region), and further down to dark
matter halos, and satellite halos. (Dark matter halos envelope
numerous smaller group of dark matter particles called satellite
halos. Each of these satellite halos are stayed together by dark
matter gravitational fields. ) </p> 
<p> - zoom out to see the simulated universe </p>


<p>
The upper left panel shows all the
particles in the box colored with respect to their velocities, the lower left panel shows a zoom-in into a dense region. The upper right panel shows a histogram of
halo velocities. The lower right panel shows only the particles that reside within halos

</p>


<p>Task 2</p>
<p> - particles can be colored by velocity,  </p>
<p></p>
<p>Task 4</p>

      <p> - Describe how users can interact with the data  </p>

     <p>- Describe any actions that you have taken for the project (downloading and cleaning data, etc.) </p>

     <p>- Present any preliminary results if any </p>

     <p>- Describe the expected results from your project  </p>
